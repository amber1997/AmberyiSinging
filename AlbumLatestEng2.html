							Inspired by a beach cleanup charity event I participated in at my previous company, where we not only picked up trash to protect the Earth but also took part in many other fun activities that fostered camaraderie among colleagues. I even made good friends with many of them. Although I chose not to stay due to personal reasons, I’m still grateful for everything—the people, experiences, and memories—that gave me so many wonderful moments and allowed me to accumulate valuable work experience!

							While taking violin lessons, I got inspired when I saw my teacher break the D string while tuning. This led me to write this song, as a reminder that everyone should have boundaries in relationships to avoid getting hurt.						</article>

							This song was written by ChatGPT, reflecting the recent easing of the pandemic and the return of freedom for many, no longer constrained by masks. Long-missed gatherings with friends, group activities, street performances, concerts, and travel are gradually being reopened, which is truly heartwarming.

This song marks a historic moment—farewell to masks!

							This is a song written for an ex. When you truly like someone, you give your all without regrets, only to realize that their heart is no longer with you. From the hopeful, happy times together to the painful breakup, it hurts deeply. What you thought could last forever ends with a painful goodbye.

This song is a collaboration with teacher Lin Ling, and the arrangement builds layer upon layer of emotions, expressing the unwillingness but inevitability of letting go. Love is not like exams or work, where hard work guarantees results. When you love the wrong person, letting go is the best choice for both. I hope those who are suffering from love can find healing soon.

"We... let's end it here. Thank you for the love you once gave. Though the happy moments were brief, they are forever etched in my heart."
