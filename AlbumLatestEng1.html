						 The book "Goodbye, Not Regretful" tells the story of two male protagonists who meet each other without overthinking it. In a miraculous turn of events, they are assigned to the same class, and gradually come to understand each other. They go to school and come home together, and even attend the same university in the same city. They share everything with each other, and this feeling seems destined. Although it is uncertain whether it will last forever, it is definitely the most profound memory in their lives.
