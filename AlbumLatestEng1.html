							This is an anonymous cooperation! The lyricist is an ER nurse . During the epidemic, he faces with a large number 
                            of patients or family members who could not considerate him, so
                            he always feels drained after work. He wrote this song to give vent to his feeling! Let's listen to their voices together!
